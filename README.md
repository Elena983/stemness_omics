We need to load the stemness model (gene weight) to further score it against your gene/protein matrix using a Spearman correlation.
In the end, you scale those correlations between 0 and 1 - what we call the stemness index

The model was primarily designed on top of gene expression data. However, weâ€™ve tried to extend its application to include spatial proteomics as well. 
The results from our paper have shown robustness when applying it to both transcriptomics and proteomics data. Although this usage is still being understood as it grows.
